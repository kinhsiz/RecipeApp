//Prisma is often used in modern web development stacks, particularly in TypeScript and Node.js projects, to streamline database access and
// management, improve developer productivity, and ensure type safety in database interactions. 
//It's commonly used in combination with frameworks like Express.js, NestJS, or GraphQL APIs to build scalable and maintainable backend systems.
